This is a recipe tracking app that I finished from some starter code. In it you are able to add recipes with info including the recipe name, style of cuisine, a photo of the completed dish, a basic list of ingredients, and basic preparation instructions.
Each recipe is also removable via a "Delete" button.

I had to add some minor Css styling to set image sizes, table coloring patterns, as well as table column widths.
